# Solved_coding_question_DSA

Here we have the record of all the best questions solved for further reference and details of each solved problem is as below
1) Count_number_of_ones.cpp: Length of longest consecutive ones
Given a binary string A. It is allowed to do at most one swap between any 0 and 1. Find and return the length of the longest consecutive 1â€™s that can be achieved.

2) Phone_letter_combination.cpp: 
Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. Return the answer in any order.
A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.
Example 1:
Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

3) hello_world.cpp:
Given a vector sort it using merge sort

4) quick_sort.cpp
Sort using quick sort

5) bit_manipulation.cpp:
Given a positive integer A, the task is to count the total number of set bits in the binary representation of all the numbers from 1 to A.
Return the count modulo 10^9 + 7.
Input 1:
 A = 3
Output 1:
 4
 
 6) Minimum_distance_in_matrix.cpp:
You are in an infinite 2D grid where you can move in any of the 8 directions
(x,y) to (x+1, y), (x - 1, y),(x, y+1), (x, y-1), (x-1, y-1), (x+1,y+1), (x-1,y+1), (x+1,y-1) 
You are given a sequence of points and the order in which you need to cover the points.. Give the minimum number of steps in which you can achieve it. You start from the first point.
