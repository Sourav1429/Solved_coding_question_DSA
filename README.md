# Solved_coding_question_DSA

Here we have the record of all the best questions solved for further reference and details of each solved problem is as below
1) Count_number_of_ones.cpp: Length of longest consecutive ones
Given a binary string A. It is allowed to do at most one swap between any 0 and 1. Find and return the length of the longest consecutive 1â€™s that can be achieved.

2) Phone_letter_combination.cpp: 
Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. Return the answer in any order.
A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.
Example 1:
Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

3) hello_world.cpp:
Given a vector sort it using merge sort

4) quick_sort.cpp
Sort using quick sort

5) bit_manipulation.cpp:
Given a positive integer A, the task is to count the total number of set bits in the binary representation of all the numbers from 1 to A.
Return the count modulo 10^9 + 7.
Input 1:
 A = 3
Output 1:
 4
 
 6) Minimum_distance_in_matrix.cpp:
You are in an infinite 2D grid where you can move in any of the 8 directions
(x,y) to (x+1, y), (x - 1, y),(x, y+1), (x, y-1), (x-1, y-1), (x+1,y+1), (x-1,y+1), (x+1,y-1) 
You are given a sequence of points and the order in which you need to cover the points.. Give the minimum number of steps in which you can achieve it. You start from the first point.

7) Special_Shop_hackerearth_solution.cpp:
Creatnx now wants to decorate his house by flower pots. He plans to buy exactly  ones. He can only buy them from Triracle's shop. There are only two kind of flower pots available in that shop. The shop is very strange. If you buy  flower pots of kind 1 then you must pay  and  if you buy  flower pots of kind 2. Please help Creatnx buys exactly  flower pots that minimizes money he pays.

8) Spiral_input.cpp: Take a mxn array and insert values in spiral order.

9) Matrix_rotation.cpp : You are given a n x n 2D matrix A representing an image.
Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise). You need to do this in place. Note: If you end up using an additional array, you will only receive partial score.

10) Strictly_greater.cpp : Given an integer array A containing N distinct integers, you have to find all the leaders in the array A. An element is leader if it is strictly greater than all the elements to its right side. NOTE:The rightmost element is always a leader.

11) Sub_array_with_0_sum.java: Given an array of integers A, find and return whether the given array contains a non-empty subarray with a sum equal to 0.
If the given array contains a sub-array with sum zero return 1 else return 0.

12) Maximum_sum_subarray.java: The aim is to find the subarray of a given array having the maximum sum value along with the index positions.

13) Reverse of a number.java: Find the reverse of a number if there is overflow return 0.

14) Check_permutation_string.java : Permutations of A in B. You are given two strings A and B of size N and M respectively.
You have to find the count of all permutations of A present in B as a substring. You can assume a string will have only lowercase letters. 

15) unique_number.java: You are given an array A of N elements. You have to make all elements unique, to do so in one step you can increase any number by one.
Find the minimum number of steps.

16) finding n_th fibbonacci: Given an integer A you need to find the Ath fibonacci number modulo 10^9 + 7

17) Equal_sum.cpp: Given an array A of N integers, find the index of values that satisfy P + Q = R + S, where P,Q,R & S are integers values in the array

18) techgig.py: Virus Outbreak 
In the Martian land faraway, a new virus has evolved and is attacking the individuals at a fast pace. The scientists have figured out the virus composition, V. The big task is to identify the people who are infected. The sample of N people is taken to check if they are POSITIVE or NEGATIVE. A report is generated which provides the current blood composition B of the person. 
POSITIVE or NEGATIVE ?
If the blood composition of the person is a subsequence of the virus composition V, then the person is identified as POSITIVE otherwise NEGATIVE.

19) techgig.cpp: Given a range[L,R] both inclusive find the prime numbers such that difference is highest. 3 cases if 2 distinct prime exist print the maximum difference
If only 1 prime then print 0. If no prime posible print "-1"
