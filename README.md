98) cyclic_permutation_my_silly_approach.java: Given two binary strings A and B, count how many cyclic permutations of B when taken XOR with A give 0. NOTE: If there is a string, S0, S1, ... Sn-1 , then it's cyclic permutation is of the form Sk, Sk+1, ... Sn-1, S0, S1, ... Sk-1 where k can be any integer from 0 to N-1.
99) cyclic_permutation_Z_algo.java: Given two binary strings A and B, count how many cyclic permutations of B when taken XOR with A give 0. NOTE: If there is a string, S0, S1, ... Sn-1 , then it's cyclic permutation is of the form Sk, Sk+1, ... Sn-1, S0, S1, ... Sk-1 where k can be any integer from 0 to N-1.
100) sliding_window_maximum.java: Given an array of integers A. There is a sliding window of size B which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the B numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves rightwards by one position. You have to find the maximum for each window. Return an array C, where C[i] is the maximum value in the array from A[i] to A[i+B-1]. Refer to the given example for clarity. NOTE: If B > length of the array, return 1 element with the max of the array.
101) k_reverse_in_linkedlist.cpp: Given a linkedlist and a value B, you need to reverse the linkedlist in k-groups. For example A=[1,2,3,4,5,6] B=3 o/p=[3,2,1,6,5,4].
102) reverse_nodes_in_k_group.py: Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list. k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is. You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.
103) sort_array_in_that_order.cpp: Given two array of integers A and B, Sort A in such a way that the relative order among the elements will be the same as those are in B. For the elements not present in B, append them at last in sorted order. Return the array A after sorting from the above method.
NOTE: Elements of B are unique.
104) remove_loop_from_link_list.cpp: Given a linked list which contains some loop. You need to find the node, which creates a loop, and break it by making the node point to NULL.
105) longest_common_prefix.cpp: Given the array of strings A, you need to find the longest string S which is the prefix of ALL the strings in the array. Longest common prefix for a pair of strings S1 and S2 is the longest string S which is the prefix of both S1 and S2. For Example: longest common prefix of "abcdefgh" and "abcefgh" is "abc".
106) min_stack.cpp: Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.
Implement the MinStack class:
MinStack() initializes the stack object.
void push(int val) pushes the element val onto the stack.
void pop() removes the element on the top of the stack.
int top() gets the top element of the stack.
int getMin() retrieves the minimum element in the stack.
107) compute C(n,r)%m.cpp: Given three integers A, B and C, where A represents n, B represents r and C represents m, find and return the value of nCr % m where nCr % m = (n!/((n-r)!*r!))% m. x! means factorial of x i.e. x! = 1 * 2 * 3... * x.
108) double_character_trouble.cpp: ou are given a string A. An operation on the string is defined as follows: Remove the first occurrence of same consecutive characters. eg for a string "abbcd", the first occurrence of same consecutive characters is "bb". Therefore the string after this operation will be "acd". Keep performing this operation on the string until there are no more occurrences of same consecutive characters and return the final string.
109) sort_stack_using_another_stack.cpp: Given a stack of integers A, sort it using another stack. Return the array of integers after sorting the stack using another stack.
